Million Song Dataset Challenge
Team Fedora

- There are two existing solutions available :  
          1. the naive approach which recommends the 500 most popular songs to everyone
          2. The open source solution which uses collaborative filtering and thereby recommends those songs which most 
              users listen to. This approach also takes ino account the number of times the songs in question are played

-Our solution:

  a)Iteration 1:
    	- we want to make the evaluation triple file more efficient and so replace the user and song strings to integer 
      	values.
      - To start with the code base we can start with coding our own version of the open source solution
      - This will be modified along the way in case we spot any regions where it is possible to improve or optimize the 
      open source solution
     
     overview of the open source solution:
     
     step 1: simplify the song,user and triplets file with integers representing songs and users.
