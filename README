Million Song Dataset Challenge
Team Fedora

- There are two existing solutions available :  
          1. the naive approach which recommends the 500 most popular songs to everyone
          2. The open source solution which uses collaborative filtering and thereby recommends those songs which most 
              users listen to. This approach also takes ino account the number of times the songs in question are played

-Our solution:

  a)Iteration 1:
    - we want to make the evaluation triple file more efficient and so replace the user and song strings to integer 
      values.
